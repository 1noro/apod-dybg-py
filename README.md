# Astronomy Picture of the Day Dynamic Background Python Version (apod-dybg-py)
Script to change daily the wallpaper of your Gnome Shell (Ubuntu) for the photo of the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" (https://apod.nasa.gov) or the "Amateur Astronomy Picture of the Day" (http://www.aapodx2.com).

In the future I would like to add support for more desktop environments (starting with XFCE).

This version is a Python revision and a rewrite of a previous project written in BASH (https://github.com/boot1110001/apod-dybg).
