# Astronomy Picture of the Day Dynamic Background
Script to change daily the wallpaper of your GNOME Shell for the photo of the "Astronomy Picture of the Day" (https://apod.nasa.gov) or the "Amateur Astronomy Picture of the Day" (http://www.aapodx2.com) according to your preference.

This version is a Python rewrite of a previous project written in BASH (https://github.com/boot1110001/apod-dybg).

In the future I would like to add support for more desktop environments (starting with XFCE).

# Requirements
This program only works currently on GNU/Linux with a GNOME Shell desktop environment.

The tests prove that it works correctly on Ubuntu 18.04.01 with GNOME Shell and the 2.7.15rc1 Python version.

Note that this project is still under development, so it is not yet stable enough.

# Installation
Currently the project is at a very early stage of its development (ALPHA), I would like to provide an installer as soon as possible.

# Credits
Created, programmed and maintained by boot1110001.

Inspired on the script of Josh Schreuder (2011) https://gist.github.com/JoshSchreuder/882666.
